# CrowdFunding
## Overview
This project is a full-stack web application that allows users to create and manage crowdfunding campaigns. It includes essential features like user authentication, campaign creation, donation processing, and a dashboard to track the progress of campaigns. The system is built using React on the frontend and Express.js on the backend, with a PostgreSQL/MySQL database for data persistence. The app also features a mock payment system to simulate donation processing.

  - Login: Users can log in to their account using their credentials.
  -  Encryption: Passwords are securely stored using bcrypt.
  - JWT: Tokens are generated using jsonwebtoken for secure user sessions.

  - Create Campaign: Authenticated users can create new crowdfunding campaigns with a title, description, and fundraising goal.
  - Campaign List: View all active campaigns available in the system.
  - Campaign Details: View detailed information of a specific campaign, including progress.
